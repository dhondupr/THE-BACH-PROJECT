# THE BACH PROJECT
The prelude of BWV846, ready to use in Processing.

## Summary ##

In summer 2017 i've started a self-initiated art-project to explore the creative potencial of musical data: THE BACH-PROJECT. The idea is very simple: I use the sheet-music of the "Prelude in C" (BWV846) by Johann Sebastian to create generative music visualizations.

## the story behind ##

The "Prelude in C" was the first piece i've learned to play on the piano. The timeless, mathematic music of J. S. Bach fascinated me from the first moment.

While studying Graphic Design and music visualization i've found out that the "Prelude in C" has a few characteristics that qualify it to be a very good material for generative music-visualizations:

+ It is monophonic, so in theory there are no notes overlapping
+ It is played on one instrument only (keyboard or clavichord or piano)
+ It follows a minimal, consistent rhythmical pattern with no variation
+ Basically it is a plain sequence of 34 bars with 16 16th-notes each
+ each bar represents a chord
+ It already has an array-like structure by nature
+ The chord-progression is interesting but quite simple

This repository contains the optimized data that can simply be used to create interesting visualizations. Do you have any ideas how the data can be optimized? Please let me know by opening an issue or by writing a mail to post@timrodenbroeker.de

I am very curious in what you make with the data. Please let me know how you use it!

Thank you!

Tim
